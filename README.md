### Hi, I'm Manuel Lang and I'm from Austria. I like sports and nature and I love watching the weather. The weather can be so fascinating. I especially like strong thrunderstorms, tornadoes and all kind of stuff like that. I also like strong wind gust and I'm really interested in hurricanes. But it's a pity that hurricanes don't occur here in Austria. And by the way, this year, I chased a small tornado here in Austria next to the boundary of Hungary, it was really great fun.
